Sure! Let's explore the differences in approach among various sorting algorithms:

### 1. Bubble Sort

**Approach**:
- **Comparison-Based**: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Iterative**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Passes**: The process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Compare and swap adjacent elements: `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`.
- Repeat until the list is sorted: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 2. Selection Sort

**Approach**:
- **Selection-Based**: Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region.
- **Iterative**: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.
- **In-Place**: Swaps elements within the array.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Find the smallest element and swap it with the first element: `[2, 3, 8, 4, 5]`.
- Repeat for the remaining elements: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 3. Insertion Sort

**Approach**:
- **Insertion-Based**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Iterative**: Takes each element and places it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.
- **In-Place**: Moves elements within the array.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Insert elements one by one: `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`, `[3, 4, 5, 8, 2]`, `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 4. Merge Sort

**Approach**:
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Recursive**: Recursively splits the list until each sublist contains a single element, then merges sublists to produce sorted lists.
- **Auxiliary Space**: Requires additional space for the temporary arrays used in merging.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Divide: `[5, 3]` and `[8, 4, 2]`.
- Recursively sort: `[3, 5]` and `[2, 4, 8]`.
- Merge: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 5. Quick Sort

**Approach**:
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
- **Recursive**: Recursively sorts sub-arrays defined by the pivot position.
- **In-Place**: Rearranges elements within the array.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Choose a pivot (e.g., `4`), partition: `[3, 2, 4, 8, 5]`.
- Recursively sort partitions: `[2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 8]`.
- Result: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 6. Heap Sort

**Approach**:
- **Heap-Based**: Utilizes a binary heap data structure to manage the maximum (or minimum) element.
- **Iterative**: Converts the array into a heap, then repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element to build the sorted array.
- **In-Place**: Rearranges elements within the array.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Build a max-heap: `[8, 5, 3, 4, 2]`.
- Extract max and heapify: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 7. Counting Sort

**Approach**:
- **Non-Comparison-Based**: Counts occurrences of each element, then uses these counts to position elements in the sorted order.
- **Iterative**: Uses auxiliary arrays to count occurrences and store the sorted output.
- **Auxiliary Space**: Requires additional space proportional to the range of the input values.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.
- Count occurrences: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`.
- Position elements: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### 8. Radix Sort

**Approach**:
- **Non-Comparison-Based**: Processes individual digits or characters, starting from the least significant to the most significant.
- **Iterative**: Uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort by each digit or character.
- **Auxiliary Space**: Requires additional space for the counting sort.

**Example**:
- Start with an unsorted list: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`.
- Sort by least significant digit: `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]`.
- Sort by next significant digit: `[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]`.
- Continue until sorted: `[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]`.

### Summary of Approaches

- **Bubble Sort**: Iteratively compares and swaps adjacent elements.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest (or largest) element and swaps it into the correct position.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct positions.
- **Merge Sort**: Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them.
- **Quick Sort**: Recursively partitions the array around a pivot and sorts the partitions.
- **Heap Sort**: Builds a heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element.
- **Counting Sort**: Counts occurrences of each element and positions them based on these counts.
- **Radix Sort**: Sorts based on individual digits or characters, using counting sort as a subroutine.

Each algorithm employs a different strategy, making them suitable for different types of data and scenarios.
